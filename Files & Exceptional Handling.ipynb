        "# 1. I/O-Bound Tasks: If your program spends a lot of time waiting for input/output operations (like reading from a file or network requests), multithreading is great. Threads can continue running while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
        "# 2. If the tasks are small and quick, creating multiple threads is generally more efficient than creating separate processes. Threads share the same memory space, making them lightweight.\n",
        "# 3. Shared Data: If you need to frequently share data between tasks, multithreading allows easier access to shared variables without the need for complex communication between processes.\n",
        "# 4. Responsiveness: In GUI applications, using threads can keep the interface responsive while performing background tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# When to Use Multiprocessing:\n",
        "# 1. CPU-Bound Tasks: For tasks that require a lot of computation (like heavy calculations or data processing), multiprocessing is better. Each process can run on a separate CPU core, making full use of available resources.\n",
        "# 2. Isolation: Processes run in their own memory space, so if one crashes, it doesn’t affect the others. This isolation is beneficial for stability in larger applications.\n",
        "# 3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In languages like Python, the GIL can limit the effectiveness of multithreading for CPU-bound tasks. Multiprocessing bypasses this limitation since each process has its own interpreter.\n",

        "# 3. Task Management: When a task is submitted to the pool, it can be assigned to an available process. This helps in managing tasks more effectively without worrying about which specific process will handle which task.\n",
        "# 4. Improved Performance: By keeping processes alive and ready to work, a process pool can handle tasks more quickly, especially in applications with many short-lived tasks.\n",
